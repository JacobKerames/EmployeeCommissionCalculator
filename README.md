# EmployeeCommissionCalculator

This program takes input of double values for the commission, base salary, and overtime of an employee to calculate their pay. Pointers are allocated memory and assigned to the memory addresses of these values. The memory addresses of each value are output to the user before memory is deallocated. In addition, output is formatted using setw() and setprecision().
